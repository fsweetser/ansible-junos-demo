  0.1.0: 2013-06-20
  
    This is *early*, so I appreciate any feedback, issues you find.  Feel free to open issues against this 
    repo or contact me via email: jschulman@juniper.net, or on Twitter: @nwkautomaniac.
    
    This drop is also harded to use the path /usr/local/junos, so you will need to create that directory.
    This directory will contain subdirs: [log, packages, configs].  You should create those too.  There
    is a file in this repo called "catalog.yml".  This file is used by the sample junos/install_os.yml
    playbook.  You need to copy this file to /usr/local/junos/packages.
